Got it 👍 You want a README.md file for your GitHub project so others can understand your Rice Leaf Disease Detection project.

Here’s a simple beginner-friendly README you can copy-paste and edit:

🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project is an AI model that detects Bacterial Leaf Blight in rice leaves using deep learning (CNN). It takes rice leaf images as input and predicts whether the leaf is Healthy or Infected.

🚀 Features

Detects Bacterial Leaf Blight disease in rice leaves.

Built using TensorFlow/Keras.

Trained on a custom dataset of rice leaf images.

Supports manual image upload for predictions.

📂 Project Structure
Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection/
│── dataset/                 # Rice leaf dataset (Healthy & Diseased images)
│── model/                   # Trained model files (.h5)
│── rice_leaf_model.ipynb    # Main Jupyter/Colab notebook
│── README.md                # Project documentation

⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies before running:

pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy


If using Google Colab, most libraries are already installed.

🖼️ Dataset

The dataset contains Healthy and Bacterial Leaf Blight rice leaf images.
👉 [Upload your dataset here]

(Replace with your Google Drive/Kaggle link once uploaded)

🧠 Model Training

Run the notebook rice_leaf_model.ipynb.

Training code example:

history = model.fit(train_ds, validation_data=val_ds, epochs=10)

📊 Model Accuracy

Check training & validation accuracy:

print("Training Accuracy:", history.history['accuracy'][-1])
print("Validation Accuracy:", history.history['val_accuracy'][-1])

🔎 Testing on New Images

You can manually upload an image in Google Colab and test:

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

# upload image manually in Colab
img_path = "uploaded_image.jpg"

img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(128,128))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

prediction = model.predict(img_array)

if prediction[0][0] > prediction[0][1]:
    print("✅ Healthy Leaf")
else:
    print("⚠️ Bacterial Leaf Blight Detected")

📌 Future Work

Add more rice leaf diseases.

Deploy model as a Web App / Mobile App for farmers.

Improve accuracy with larger datasets.
