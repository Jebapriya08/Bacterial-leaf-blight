# Rice Leaf Disease Detection ðŸŒ¿

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify rice leaves as:
- Healthy
- Bacterial Leaf Blight

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Download dataset from [Google Drive/Kaggle link].
3. Train the model or load the provided `.h5` file.
4. Upload a leaf image and check the prediction.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `rice_leaf_detection.ipynb` â†’ Training and testing code
- `model.h5` â†’ Trained model file
- Dataset â†’ [Dataset Link](/content/drive/MyDrive/leaf dataset
)

## ðŸ“Š Results
Model Accuracy: **98.55%**
